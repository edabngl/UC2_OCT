#### LED

LED is used with dichroic long pass filter and Kohler illumination together in the setup as an illumination part.

*Properties of the LED source:*
    3 W High Power
    2,4 - 3,3 V
    max 700 mA

## Connection of LED

LED is high power. The brightness of the light is very high and heat in the time can be problem during experiments and LED can burn. Because of these reasons, 2 parallel 100 ohm resistors were connected to the LED serial and dropped the power of illuminated light.

Calculation of this step is very simple.

V = I  x R

I : current of the LED  1 ohm = 1 V/A
R : equivalent resistance of the resistors in the circuit
V :

2 x 100 ohm resistor connected in parallel.
R_eq = (1/100)+(1/100) = 50 ohm

V is 5 V.

I = 5 V / 50 ohm = 0,1 A = 100 mA
