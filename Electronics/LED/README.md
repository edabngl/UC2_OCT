#### LED

LED is used with dichroic long pass filter and KÃ¶hler illumination together in the setup as an illumination part.

*Properties of the LED source:*
    3 W High Power
    2,4 - 3,3 V
    max 700 mA

## Connection of LED

LED is high power. The brightness of the light is very high and heat in the time can be problem during experiments and LED can burn. Because of these reasons, 2 parallel 100 ohm resistors were connected to the LED serial and dropped the power of illuminated light.

Calculation of this step is very simple.

V = I  x R

I : current of the LED  1 ohm = 1 V/A
R : equivalent resistance of the resistors in the circuit
V :

2 x 100 ohm resistor connected in parallel.
R_eq = (1/100)+(1/100) = 50 ohm

V is 5 V.

I = 5 V / 50 ohm = 0,1 A = 100 mA

#### LASER

Pen-lasers were used in the beggining for the alignment , blue UV and green VIS lasers. Green laser was so powerful. I tried to reduce the power using ND filter but instead of that I changed the laser.

In the alignment part of the Thorlabs setup, [RGB Laser source]() was used with red paper filter.
