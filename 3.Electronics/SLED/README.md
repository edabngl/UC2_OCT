A superluminescent diode (SLED or SLD) is an edge-emitting semiconductor light source based on superluminescence. It combines the high power and brightness of laser diodes with the low coherence of conventional light-emitting diodes. (WIKI)
Some application areas are optical coherence tomography, white light interferometry, optical sensing and fibre optic gyroscopes.

In OCT systems, SLED is most used light source option because of its low coherence and high spatical coherence.

*Properties of the a proper SLED source for OCT system:*
* Low Coherence light source
* high Power
* high brightness

Some applications take advantage of the low temporal coherence of SLEDs sources to achieve high spatial resolution in imaging techniques.
*The coherence length*, L_c, is a quantity frequently used to characterize the temporal coherence of the light source. It is related to the path difference between the two arms of an optical interferometer over which the light wave is still capable to generate an interference pattern.
For sources having a Gaussian spectral distribution, the value of L_c is inversely proportional to the spectral width, BW, so that the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the power spectral density can be related to L_c through the equation

L_c = (λ^2) / (B*W)

where λ (lambda) is the central wavelength of the emitted radiation.

As an example, an SLED operating around 1300 nm and with an optical bandwidth of 100 nm is expected to have a coherence length of about 17 μm. From a practical point of view a definition independent on the spectral distribution (non-Gaussian spectrum) of the source is more suitable.
If an optical interferometer is used for the coherence length evaluation a useful quantity is the FWHM value of the visibility, that is the relative amplitude [(Ipeak - Ivalley) / (Ipeak + Ivalley)] of the intensity variations evaluated as a function of the interferometer imbalance.

SLEDs exhibit a large spectral width even at the highest power levels so that corresponding FWHM values of the visibility less than **20 μm** are easily achieved. (WIKI)
