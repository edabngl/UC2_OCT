# Köhler Illumination

Below we describe how the Köhler Illumination Module in UC2 system can be build and assembled in order to replicate the whole system as shown in the rendering above.

In the setup, we use red LED light source. It's a cheap component and illuminated light is incoherent. Adding additional Dichroic Longpass filter and Köhler Illumination part, we obtain almost collimated and higher coherence length light source.

## Köhler Illumination with Thorlabs Equipment

In the Thorlabs system, we used 5 different components to create Köhler Illumination.
* Pinhole
* Aperture
* Plano-convex lens as collector
* Plano-convex lens
* Achromatic lens

* Pinhole is made by Aluminium foil with a dot (with needle).
* Aperture is adjustable 3D-printed module in UC2 version.

### 3D printing files

      All these files need to be printed. We used a Prusa i3 MK3 using PLA Prusament (Galaxy Black) at layer height x.x mm and infill xx%.
      The original design files are in the [INVENTOR](./Hardware/INVENTOR) folder.
      The files for 3D-printing are in the [STL](./Hardware/STL) folder.

      |---|---|---|---|---|
      | Aperture |  *It creates an adjustable aperture* |  1  |  x,xx € | [Design File](.../Hardware/INVENTOR)  | [Part.stl](.../Hardware/STL/)  |
