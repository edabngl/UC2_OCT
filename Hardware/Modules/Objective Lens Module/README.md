2 objective lenses are used in the system. Incoming light beam are split into two part with Beam-splitter Module. Beams travel into two different path. These beams pass through the objective lenses and focuses on the next optical elements ( reference mirror and sample or sample mirror).

*Properties of the objective lenses*

More details about the 3D-printing, assembling and setting up can be found in [UC2-GIT]() repository in detail.
