#### Objective Lens Module

Below we describe how the Objective Lens Module can be build and assembled in order to replicate the whole system as shown in the rendering above.

2 objective lenses are used in the system. Incoming light beam are split into two part with Beam-splitter Module. Beams travel into two different path. These beams pass through the objective lenses and focuses on the next optical elements ( reference mirror and sample or sample mirror).

### 3D printing files

  All these files need to be printed. We used a Prusa i3 MK3 using PLA Prusament (Galaxy Black) at layer height x.x mm and infill xx%.
  The original design files are in the [INVENTOR](./INVENTOR) folder.
  The files for 3D-printing are in the [STL](./STL) folder.
