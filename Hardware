Hardware Part of UC2-OCT is built by 3D-printd UC2 modules. Some of the modules are already used in the previous UC2 applications. 
Some of the parts are designed for this application or redesigned for some parts. 

Componenets of 3D-printed Part of the Setup:

  1. [Light Source Module]()
  2. Reference Mirror Module
  3. Sample Module 
  4. Beam Splitter Module
  5. Camera Module
  6. 2x Objective Lens Modules
  7. Köhler Illumination Module: 
    1) Pinhole
    2) Aperture
    3) Plano-convex lens as collector
    4) Plano-convex lens
    5) Achromatic lens
    
  
##Köhler Illumination

In the setup, we use red LED light source. It's a cheap component and illuminated light is incoherent. Adding additional Dichroic Longpass filter and Köhler Illumination part, we obtaine almost collimated and higher coherence length light source.
