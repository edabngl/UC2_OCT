# Alignment Procedures

This repository will help you to build and alignment process of *UC2-OCT*.

*In this project, we will design a low-cost, 3D-printed, time-domain Optical Coherence Tomography based on UC2 system.*
We started to build our setup with basic version; Michelson Interferometer. Then, the setup will be adapted to the UC2 System with 3D-Printed inserts, Injection Molding (IM) cubes and cheap components.

## Alignment Procedure of Michelson Interferometer with Laser

I used different articles to follow in the alignment process.
_1st article_ is [](). In this article 2 important steps of the alignment process is explained in detail. Our aim is to see interference fringes. To make the process easier I prefered to used [RGB Laser](.../3.Electronics/LASER)

_2nd technic_ is observing Fresnel Interference to obtain almost same arm distances for two mirrors.
