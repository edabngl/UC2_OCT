#Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) & Time Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (TD-OCT)


# Full-Field Optical Coherence Tomography (FF-OCT)
Invented by Claude Boccara in 1998 (France).
Resolution: 1um in 3D

Full-field optical coherence tomography (FF-OCT) or optical coherence microscopy (OCM) is commonly constructed in a Linnik or Michelson interferometer configuration—that is, with or without microscope objectives.
*Working Principle:* FF-OCT employs a 2-D image sensor like a CCD or CMOS camera as the detector, and en-face images of the sample are acquired at different depths by coherence gating.

* High axial and lateral resolutions are possible with FF-OCT.
* The use of FF-OCT in the time-domain configuration avoids specialized and potentially expensive components such as galvanometer or MEMS micromirror scanners, swept-sources and even superluminescent diode (SLED) or halogen or supercontinuum sources. Simple LEDs provide sufficient illumination for sub-10-μm imaging. Such a system has the potential to create high resolution 3D
tomograms at very low cost.



# openUC2 *Time-Domain, Full-Field, Low-Cost, 3D-Printed Optical Coherence Tomography*

In this project, we will design a low-cost, 3D-printed, time-domain Optical Coherence Tomography based on UC2 system.

***Features of the UC2-OCT Project:***
