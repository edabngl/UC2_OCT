# openUC2 *Time-Domain, Full-Field, Low-Cost, 3D-Printed Optical Coherence Tomography*

In this project, we will design a low-cost, 3D-printed, time-domain Optical Coherence Tomography based on UC2 system.

***Features of the UC2-OCT Project:***
* Low-cost : total cost of the 3D-printed system will be under 1000 â‚¬.
* Easy to assemble
* Open-Source
* 3D-Printed

***Key Parameters of the UC2-OCT Project:***
*  cheap Light Source (red High Power star LED)
*  cheap optical filters (Comar Longpass Filter)
*  cheap Detector (RasPi camera and Raspi 4)
*  cheap electronics (ESP-32S as microcontroller)
*  low-cost, light Silver Mirror (DIY)
