# openUC2 *Time-Domain, Full-Field, Low-Cost, 3D-Printed Optical Coherence Tomography*
---

This repository will help you to build and setup *UC2-OCT*.

*In this project, we will design a low-cost, 3D-printed, time-domain Optical Coherence Tomography based on UC2 system.*
We started to build our setup with basic version; Michelson Interferometer. Then, the setup will be adapted to the UC2 System with 3D-Printed inserts, Injection Molding (IM) cubes and cheap components.

***Features of the Project:***
* Low-cost : total cost of the 3D-printed system will be under 1000 â‚¬.
* Easy to assemble
* Open-Source
* 3D-Printed

***Key Parameters of the Project:***
*  cheap Light Source (red High Power star LED)
*  cheap optical filters (Comar Longpass Filter)
*  cheap Detector (RasPi camera and Raspi 4)
*  cheap electronics (ESP-32S as microcontroller)
*  low-cost, light Silver Mirror (DIY)

#### Project Timeline:

  * Using Thorlab equipments, Michelson Interferometer was built with a RGB Laser and Red filter. __SEP 2021__
  * Using Thorlab equipments, Michelson Interferometer was built with a red LED light source and dichroic longpass filter. __OCT 2021__    **IN PROGRESS**   

   __NEXT STEPS:__
  * Using Thorlab equipments, Michelson Interferometer was built with a red LED light source and dichroic longpass filter. Voice Coil Actuator is inserted setup for moving the sample mirror. __OCT 2021__  
  * Working Thorlabs system will be adapted to the UC2 version. 3D-printed parts will be designed or adapted to the project. __OCT 2021__
