# OCT with openUC2 *Time-Domain, Low-Cost, 3D-Printed Optical Coherence Tomography*
---

This repository will help you to build and setup *UC2-OCT*.

*In this project, we will design a low-cost, 3D-printed, time-domain Optical Coherence Tomography based on UC2 system.*
We started to build our setup with basic version; Michelson Interferometer. Then, the setup will be adapted to the UC2 System with 3D-Printed inserts, Injection Molding (IM) cubes and cheap components.

***Features of the Project:***
* Low-cost : total cost of the 3D-printed system will be under 1500 â‚¬.
* Easy to assemble
* Open-Source
* 3D-Printed

***Key Parameters of the Project:***
*  cheap Light Source (red High Power LED)
*  cheap optical filters (Comar Longpass Filter etc.)
*  cheap Detector (RasPi camera and Raspi 4, Vision Camera)
*  cheap electronics (ESP-32S as microcontroller)
*  low-cost, light Gold-coated Mirror (DIY)

##         Project Timeline:

| Date | To Do | Status of the Task |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **September 2021** | Using Thorlab equipments, Michelson Interferometer was built with a RGB Laser and Red paper filter. | `DONE` |
| **October 2021** | Using Thorlab equipments, Michelson Interferometer is building with a red LED light source and dichroic longpass filter | `CANCELLED` |
| ** 5 November 2021** | Reference mirror with Voice coil actuators will be adapted to the 3D-printed system.  | `DONE by Benedict but NOT USED FOR NOW` |
| **12 November 2021** | Cheap SLD light source was found from EXALOS and ordered. It will arrive in December. Extra driver module should be ordered.  | `DONE` |
| **24-26 November 2021** | Working Thorlabs system (with laser) was adapted to the UC2 version as basic version of Michelson Interferometer. 3D-printed parts will be redesigned or adapted to the project. | `DONE` |
