# Alignment Procedures

This repository will help you to build and alignment process of *UC2-OCT*.

*In this project, we will design a low-cost, 3D-printed, time-domain Optical Coherence Tomography based on UC2 system.*
We started to build our setup with basic version; Michelson Interferometer. Then, the FF-TD-OCT setup will be adapted to the UC2 System with 3D-Printed inserts, Injection Molding (IM) cubes and low-cost components.

## Alignment Procedure of Michelson Interferometer with Laser

Experimental Sketch of UC2-Oct with different light sources with the order of alignment procedure;

1st Configuration is with Laser light source and focusing light beams onto the Reference and Sample Mirrors.

2nd Configuration is with Laser light source and additional lens after laser module. It's illuminating light beams parallel onto the Reference and Sample Mirrors.

3rd Configuration is with LED light source. Firstly, the light beam is illuminated to Beamsplitter cube with an KÃ¶hler Illumination. Light is focused on the back focal plane of the objective lenses (it will be like that? check the configuraton again!!!!).

#### Previous Method

I used different articles to follow in the alignment process.
_1st article_ is [](). In this article 2 important steps of the alignment process is explained in detail. Our aim is to see interference fringes. To make the process easier I prefered to used [RGB Laser](.../3.Electronics/LASER)

* 1st step is

_2nd technic_ is observing Fresnel Interference to obtain almost same arm distances for two mirrors.
