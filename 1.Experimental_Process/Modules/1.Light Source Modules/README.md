During the project, different type of low-cost light sources were used for different purposes: [LASER]() and [LED]().

### Coherence of The Light sources





#### LASER

Pen-lasers were used in the beggining for the alignment , blue UV and green VIS lasers. Green laser was so powerful. I tried to reduce the power using ND filter but instead of that I changed the laser.

In the alignment part of the Thorlabs setup, [RGB Laser source]() was used with red paper filter.

#### LED

After alignment of the mirrors in the setup,laser illumination part was changed with [red LED light source]() + [long-pass filter]() + [Köhler illumination module](.../Köhler Illumination).

Spectrum of the red LED:

## Dichroic Longpass filter

A I mentioned below, the coherence length of the light source is the key parameter for the OCT system. When we use cheap incoherent light source, it is low-coherence length and hard to see interference fringes in the system.
To increase the coherence length of the light source, long-pass filter is a good option.

We used Comar Dichroic Longpass Filter. The spectrum of the filter is shown here:

FWHM decreases to .....
So coherence length of the LED becomes .....
