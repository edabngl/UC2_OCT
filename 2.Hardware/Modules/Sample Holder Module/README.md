# Sample Mirror Module

Below we describe how the Sample Mirror Module in UC2 system can be build and assembled in order to replicate the whole system as shown in the rendering above.

Incoming light beam are split into two part with Beam-splitter Module. Beams travel into two different path. These beams pass through the objective lenses and focuses on the reference mirror and sample mirror. In this section, we are giving more details about Sample Mirror Module.

In Thorlabs System, protected silver mirror was used in the reference and sample arm. The module with Thorlabs component is shown in the next image:

But this mirror is heavy to use in 3D-printing system and we searched some methods to obtain light slver coated mirror which is moved by voice coil actuator.

## Thin Lightweight Silver or Gold Coated Mirror
The idea is the coating of microscope cover slip with gold (in IPHT clean room) or gold in the lab.

## Kinematic Mirror Mount design
We needed a new design for this system.

### 3D printing files

  All these files need to be printed. We used a Prusa i3 MK3 using PLA Prusament (Galaxy Black) at layer height x.x mm and infill xx%.
  The original design files are in the [INVENTOR](./Hardware/INVENTOR) folder.
  The files for 3D-printing are in the [STL](./Hardware/STL) folder.

In Thorlabs System, two mirrors are used both optical path. In 3D-printed version, one silver mirror is used only for Reference Mirror Module.
