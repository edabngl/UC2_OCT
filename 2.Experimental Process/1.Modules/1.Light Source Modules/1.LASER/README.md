# LASER

Pen-lasers were used in the begging for the alignment , blue UV and green VIS lasers. Green laser was so powerful. I tried to reduce the power using ND filter but instead of that I changed the laser.

In the alignment part of the Thorlabs setup, [RGB Laser source]() was used with red paper filter.
